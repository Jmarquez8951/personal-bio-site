    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>I am an eighteen year old who really enjoys coding. I came from Mexico at a very young age and lived almost my entire life in Murfreesboro, TN. I graduated with Honors from Riverdale High School with almost a 3.9 GPA. I had thousands of dollars worth of scholarships, but not enough to pay for college.</p>
    <p>I started coding when I was in High School on a whim. I say that because I took the class not knowing what to expect and I ended up loving it. My first year I dabbled in a little bit of everything from HTML to Python to even a little bit of C#. I did a little bit of C# because I wanted to go into game development, but ended up not doing so. My Sophomore year in High school I was being taught visual studio code from a book, so I kind of learned from there that I will be learning and teaching myself to code. My Junior year in High school I was the last year I could do the programming course at my school because there weren't enough people to game a fourth year class. Still, I continued to code throughout the year with many different types of languages.</p>
    <h2>Why do I want to go into development?</h2>
    <p>I want to go into development because I have always liked a challenge and with development you will face new challenges every single day. I also like development because I have always wanted to make a difference in this world and I believe there's a better chance at doing so being a web developer than being a game developer.</p>
    <h2>What do you love about development?</h2>
    <p>I have always been drawn towards technology ever since a young age. I used to play with legos so that's why I think I like creating things from websites to drawings to even little games that I have made in the past during High school. I love everything about development. I enjoyed the little challenges I faced while programming with visual studio code in High school. It was fun to me to think of a solution and see it actually work. There were many many times when my ideas didn't work, but when it finally does there is no better feeling.</p>
